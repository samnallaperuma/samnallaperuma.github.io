<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sam is a program committee member in the Special Session on Theoretical Foundations of Bio-inspired Computation in 2013-2016 at IEEE CEC and the theory track of GECCO 2016 and 2017. She has co-organized the “Simulated Car Racing Championship” at GECCO 2015 and student workshop at GECCO 2016. She is also serving as a reviewer for Evolutionary Computation Journal (MIT Press), Algorithamica, IEEE transactions in Evolutionary Computation and conferences including PPSN, SEA, TPNC. Her work focuses on understanding the influence of problem and algorithm parameters on the performance of randomized search heuristics and applying evolutionary optimisation techniques to solve real world problems in rail industry.</span></p>
